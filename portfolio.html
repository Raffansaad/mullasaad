                <img width="300px" src="./image copy 4.png" alt="CarSensor">
                <p>
                    In recent years, vehicle detection and classification have become essential tasks of intelligent transportation systems, and real-time, accurate vehicle detection from image and video data for traffic monitoring remains challenging. The most noteworthy challenges are real-time system operation to accurately locate and classify vehicles in traffic flows and working around total occlusions that hinder vehicle tracking. For real-time traffic monitoring, we present a traffic monitoring approach that overcomes the above mentioned challenges by employing convolution neural networks that utilize You Only Look Once (YOLO). A real-time traffic monitoring system has been developed, and it has attracted significant attention from traffic management departments. Digitally processing and analyzing these videos in real time is crucial for extracting reliable data on traffic flow. Therefore, this study presents a real-time traffic monitoring system based on a virtual detection zone, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and YOLO to increase the vehicle counting and classification efficiency.

            <p>
                A "real-time vehicle traffic monitoring system" uses sensors like cameras, radar, or inductive loops to continuously collect data about vehicle movement on roads, allowing for immediate analysis and display of traffic conditions like congestion levels, vehicle speeds, and counts, typically through a centralized platform, enabling informed traffic management decisions in real-time

            <img width="300px" src="./image copy 3.png" alt="">
            <p>
                By monitoring and controlling city activities in actual time, the paradigm's Internet of Things (IoT) has a critical role in application development for smart cities. Sold waste administration is one of the most significant concerns related to smart city applications, as it has a detrimental influence on our general public's well-being and, therefore, the climate. The waste administration process begins with squander produced by city occupants and disposed of in trash bins at the source. Civil division trucks gather junk and transport it to reusing destinations on a gathering plan. Districts and waste administration organizations neglect to monitor outside holders, making it difficult to know when they ought to be purged or scoured. An IoT -empowered strong waste administration framework is proposed in this paper for shrewd urban areas to beat the imperatives of the quality waste administration frameworks. </p>
